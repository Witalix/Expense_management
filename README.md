###Expense Management
"Expense Management" is a web application designed to streamline personal finance management. Developed using Django and hosted on Docker, this application allows users to efficiently monitor, add, edit, and delete expenses and incomes associated with their budget.
The user interface is designed intuitively, enabling easy addition of new expense and income categories, allowing users to customize the application to their individual financial needs. Additionally, users can track their expenses in various categories and manage their payment methods.
One of the key features of the application is generating diagrams and reports based on the entered data, enabling users to better understand their finances and make more informed decisions. Furthermore, the application offers the ability to add assigned expenses to specific time periods, facilitating analysis and budget planning for the future.
The future development plans for the application include integrating additional features such as automatic reminders of upcoming payments and the ability to import data from external sources to further streamline the financial management process.
The "Expense Management" project not only serves as a practical tool for monitoring finances but also as a confirmation of the skills and knowledge acquired during the Python programming course at CodersLab.
